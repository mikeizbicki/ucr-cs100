#/bin/bash

# This script takes a mode, a test file, and (optionally)
# a delay as parameters and runs the test files in the
# given mode with the delay between commands.
#
# usage:
# cs100-runtests mode testFile[s] [delay]
#
#
# mode: can be "rshell", "bash", or the path to an
#    executable. rshell mode runs "bin/rshell". bash
#    mode runs "bash -i". Any executable passed in
#    is invoked verbatim
# 
# testFile[s]: the file containing the tests. The name
#    undergoes filename expansion
#    (see https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html)
#
# delay: the number of microseconds to wait between
#    commands. gets passed directly to usleep. (see man usleep)
#
#
# Outputs:
#   * prints the name of the file currently being tested
#     surrounded in stars
#   * prints 80 '=' characters denoting start of tests
#   * runs the program specified by mode, adjusting as
#     needed.
#   * prints 80 '=' characters denoting end of test
