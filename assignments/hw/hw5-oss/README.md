## giving back to the open source community

### requirements

For this assignment, you must give something back to the open source community.  One common problem with open source software is a lack of documentation and easily accessible tutorials.  You will create some.  Future students of this class (and random strangers on the internet) will be using your tutorials to help them learn.

Your tutorial should be between 1000-2000 words.  (Exceptional tutorials may be as short as 500 words with approval from the instructor.)  It should have plenty of code examples and/or pictures illustrating your topic.

Possible topics include:

* how to use `vim`, `git`, `gdb`, `valgrind`, or any other tool effectively

* how to use syscalls like `fork`, `exec`, `perror`, etc.

* some cool tricks for writing scripts in bash

* interesting features about the C or C++ programming languages

You should pick a topic that initially confused you, and explain it in a way that makes sense to you.  This will help future students master the topic.

One simple way to format these tutorials is as a "top ten list."  For example, the project might be "the top ten most useful bash commands."  Then provide ten commands from bash and show how they work and why they're useful.

### collaboration policy

You may work in a team on this assignment, or you may work individually.  Teams can be of any size, but a larger team must give a larger contribution.

You are ENCOURAGED to discuss this assignment with anyone, whether they are on your team or not.

You must NOT copy and paste someone's blog post on the internet.

### submission instructions

There are two submissions for this assignment.  The first is part is due on **Thursday, Aug 14**.  In this submission, you must type a short paragraph describing what your tutorial will be about, and who will be on your team.  You should print this document and turn it in in class.  I will use this submission to ensure your topic is appropriate.

Your second submission is due on midnight, **Thursday, Aug 28**.  This will be the final submission for your project.  You must submit your tutorial as a pull request on this repository through github.  Create a folder in this repo called `/tutorials/yoursubject`.  Inside the folder should be at least a file called `README.md` that contains the contents of your tutorial.   You may include other files in this folder, such as images or cpp files, if they are relevant to the tutorial.  I will evaluate the pull request the same as any other pull request into an open source project.

### grading

50 points for technical accuracy

50 points for engaging writing style

It is VERY important that your submission be written in an engaging style.  It should be something other programmers enjoy reading.

If your submission earns an A, we will share it with thousands of other programmers on the internet via websites like http://reddit.com.
