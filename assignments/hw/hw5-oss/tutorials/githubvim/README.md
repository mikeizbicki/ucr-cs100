Learn To Use GitHub, vim, The Terminal, & More!
===
Have you never used a **Terminal** in your life?  
Are you struggling with **GitHub**?  
Do you have no idea how to even use a **vim**?!  
Do you wonder what a **vim** even means?

We were three student, lost, confused, and not knowing how to survive life in CS100, but we won't let that happen to you! That's why we've created this mini-series to help guide you through this process and help you achieve the greatness you possess within you. I'm not saying that these video tutorials will give you a 100% in the class, but we can GUARANTEE you'll have a head start in the class.

Our names are Rashid, Kyler, and Shawn, Junior Computer Science Majors at the *University of California, Riverside*-and our mission was to present a series of videos designed to help you learn the basics of the Terminal, `vim`, GitHub, and more! Hopefully you find our tutorials helpful in any of your future coding practices.
