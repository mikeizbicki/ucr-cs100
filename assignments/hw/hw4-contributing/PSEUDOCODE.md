Why use pseudocode?
-------------------
Pseudocode may sound like a generic concept, but you can think of it as an outline of your code. Just like an outline of an essay/research paper you may start out with a simple outline (example one). You also need to consider the flow of information and move paragraphs around to create the best story (second example). As the essay development continues your outline fills in and you ultimately end up with a just a few points of concern (third example). Eventually everything comes together and you have a complete essay (see the function program).

What are some advantages of pseudocode?

  <li>Use it as a way of determining objects in your code (help with OOP)</li>
  <li>Use it to determine the best logic for your code</li>
  <li>Communicate your ideas to gain opinions/suggestions from other programmers</li>
</ol>
