# learning `vim`

In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the `vim` text editor.  In this class, you must use `vim` for all homework and lab assignments.  At first, you will find that `vim` is very weird.  But with practice, you will find `vim` much more powerful than either the `geany` or `Cloud9` editors you are already familiar with.  

The key to mastering `vim` is practice.  Therefore, you are required to use `vim` for all lab and homeworks assignments in this course.  **Using any editor other than `vim` will result in a 0 on the assignment.**

Open up a terminal and type the command `vimtutor` to get started.  This command walks you through the basics of using the `vim` editor.  Don't just read the file!!!  Make sure to actually do the exercises!!!

Once you have finished that, start playing the game: http://vim-adventures.com.
The first three levels are free (and that's all you're required to do).
You're welcome to pay for the full game if you want, but I'm not requiring you to do so.
And you won't get any extra credit for it.
