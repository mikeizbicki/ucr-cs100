# more buggy programs in C++

You should complete this lab using pair programming with a new partner.

### coding instructions

In this lab, you will continue to practice your debugging skills.  This time, there are only two buggy programs, but they are more difficult.  You and your partner need to find and fix all of bugs in each program.  When you find a bug, comment in the code what you corrected.

You should use `gdb` to help you find the bugs.  In particular, you are NOT allowed to use print statements in your program.  This [gdb cheatsheet](http://betterexplained.com/articles/debugging-with-gdb/) might help.

### Deliverables:

When finished, demo your working code for the TA.
