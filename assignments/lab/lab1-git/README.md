#Introduction to git

The version control system(VCS) `git` is one of VCS tools used for tracking changes in your project.
This tool is developed by Linus Torvaldus.

If you have ever made a change to a project and wish that you could go back before you made that change, a VCS can help.
A VCS tracks changes you make to a project and will allow you to return to a saved point.


This lab contains three exercises. 
The first exercise will introduce you to `git` and will step you through some basic git commands.
The second exercise will introduce you to some more advanced `git` commands as well as more options for the ones learned in exercise one.
The third exercise will enroll you in the course.
You are not officially enrolled in this course until you finish that portion of the lab.
