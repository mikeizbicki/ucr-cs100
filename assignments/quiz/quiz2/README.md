# quiz 2: data structures review

Pick any program you want.  Print out a screenshot.  On the back of the printout list 20 examples of data structures, abstract data types (ADTs), or algorithms that might be used internally in the program.  Your examples must be present in the screenshot.  You are only allowed to pick examples from the following lists, and you must provide at least one example for each entry in the list.

Abstract data types and data structures:

1. The stack ADT

2. The queue ADT

3. The binary search tree data structure (you must clearly identify what would happen to the program if the tree were not balanced)

4. The heap data structure

5. The map ADT (you must clearly identify what the keys and values are)

6. The set ADT

7. The priority queue ADT

8. The graph ADT (you must clearly identify what the nodes and edges are)

Algorithms:

1. Sorting

2. Dijkstra

3. Primm/Kruskal
