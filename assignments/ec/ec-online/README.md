## online communities

Participating in online programming communities is a fun way to expand your programming knowledge.
I want to encourage you to participate.
Here are four ways you can get extra credit from participation:

1. Every programmer should have a webpage.
If you create a webpage showing off your portfolio,
I will give you between 5-25 points extra credit depending on the quality.
This webpage must be hosted on your own personal domain, and cannot be hosted on UCR's domain.
If you want an example, you can visit my webpage at https://izbicki.me.

1. If you have a project on github that earns more than 10 stars, you will get 10 points extra credit.
Stars from fellow cs100 students count as only 1/4 a star.

2. If you star 20 repos created by other people, you will get 5 points extra credit.
Some good places to look for cool repos are other students in this class or the [/r/coolgithubprojects](http://reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects) subreddit.

2. If you have a stackoverflow account with more than 100 points, you will get 10 points extra credit.
If you have a stackoverflow account with more than 1000 points, you will get an *additional* 20 points extra credit.
You do not need to have created the account or earned the points during this quarter.

3. If you submit something to the front page of [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming) that gets more than 200 upvotes, you will get 10 points extra credit.

4. If you submit something to the front page of [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com) that gets more than 30 upvotes, you will get 10 points extra credit.

**IMPORTANT:** You may receive each extra credit only once.
