## online communities

Participating in online programming communities is a fun way to expand your programming knowledge.
I want to encourage you to participate.
Here are four ways you can get extra credit from participation:

1. If you have a project on github that earns more than 10 stars, you will get 5 points extra credit.
Stars from fellow cs100 students count as only 1/4 a star.

2. If you star 20 repos created by other people, you will get 5 points extra credit.
Some good places to look for cool repos are other students in this class or the [/r/coolgithubprojects](http://reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects) subreddit.

2. If you have a stackoverflow account with more than 100 points, you will get 10 points extra credit.
If you have a stackoverflow account with more than 1000 points, you will get an *additional* 20 points extra credit.
You do not need to have created the account or earned the points during this quarter.

3. If you submit something to the front page of [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming) that gets more than 200 upvotes, you will get 10 points extra credit.

4. If you submit something to the front page of [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com) that gets more than 30 upvotes, you will get 10 points extra credit.

**IMPORTANT:** You may receive each extra credit only once.
