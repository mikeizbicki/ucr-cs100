# hacker reading

There are a lot of books that have made it into the "hacker culture."
Reading them is a fun way to get better at programming.
I will give you up to 10 points of extra credit if you read any of the following books and discuss it with me:

2.  Douglas Hofstadter's *Gödel, Escher, and Bach*.

3.  Peter Seibel's *Coders at Work*

4.  Jessica Livingston's *Founders at Work*.

5.  Chad Fowler's *The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development*

You may also suggest another book that you think has hacker value.
If I agree, I'll add it to the list.
(Or you can add it as a pull request for even more extra credit...)

**IMPORTANT:** If you've already read one of these books, that doesn't count.
Read a different one.
In addition, you may only read one of these books for extra credit during the quarter.
