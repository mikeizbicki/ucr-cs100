# play a game for homework!

*This is an optional extra credit homework assignment.*

In this homework assignment, you will play a game!  The game is at http://vim-adventures.com.  By playing the game, you will get better at using the `vim` commands.

The first three levels are free.  The remaining levels require you to pay $25 to the website.  You are not required to pay this money and complete the game.  By default, this assignment will not be factored into your grade. This is worth up to 15 points extra credit.
