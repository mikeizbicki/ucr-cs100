# play a game for homework!

*This is an optional extra credit homework assignment.*

In this homework assignment, you will play a game!  The game is at http://vim-adventures.com.  By playing the game, you will get better at using the `vim` commands.

The first three levels are free.  The remaining levels require you to pay $25 to the website. You will receive 15 points extra credit if you can show the instructor that you completed the game. (note: past cs100 students stated that completion took about 20 hours, with the majority of the time spent in the last few levels).
