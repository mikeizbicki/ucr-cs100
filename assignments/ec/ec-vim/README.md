# play a game for homework!

*This is an optional extra credit homework assignment.*

In this homework assignment, you will play a game!  The game is at http://vim-adventures.com.  By playing the game, you will get better at using the `vim` commands.

The first three levels are free.  The remaining levels require you to pay $25 to the website.  You are not required to pay this money and complete the game.  By default, this assignment will not be factored into your grade. This is worth 15 points in extra credit contingent upon you showing me that you have completed the entire game. (Note: past CS100 students have stated that it has taken them about 20 hours to complete, with the majority of the time spent on the last few levels) Good Luck!
