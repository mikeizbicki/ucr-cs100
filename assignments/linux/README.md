## a local Linux installation

Install Linux on your personal desktop/laptop computer.
I personally use the [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and [Slackware](http://slackware.com) distributions, but you're free to choose whatever distribution you like.
The lab machines use [CentOS](http://www.centos.org).

There are two ways you can install Linux.
The first is as a dual boot operating system.
Every Linux distribution's installer will walk you through how to do this.
But be careful!
It's very easy to accidentally erase all your old data!
So make backups first!

The second option is as a virtual machine inside of your windows/mac computer.
This option will earn you a little bit less credit on the assignment, but is easier to set up.

**RECOMENDATION:**
Make this a group activity.
Get together with some of your classmates and spend a Saturday installing Linux on everyone's computers.
It will be a lot more fun this way, and you'll be able to help each other out when you get stuck.

### grading

25 / 25 points for a fully working bootable Linux installation.

20 / 25 points for a virtual machine Linux installation.

If you installed Linux onto a laptop, bring your laptop to class and I will check you off.  You must have wireless internet working for full credit!

If you installed Linux onto a desktop machine, then we will ssh into your desktop from the school account.  You must install the ssh daemon and configure your network routing appropriately.

**IMPORTANT:**
If you already have Linux installed on one of your machines, you do NOT have to reinstall it for this assignment.
You will get full credit.

**IMPORTANT:**
If you do not have a personal computer to install Linux on, see me and I'll work out an alternate assignment.

#### extra credit

+5 points if you install the [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) tiling window manager and use it as your default

+5 points if you set up your computer as a [tor relay](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en)
