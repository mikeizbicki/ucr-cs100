## a local Linux installation

Install Linux on your personal desktop/laptop computer.
I personally use the [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and [Slackware](http://slackware.com) distributions, but you're free to choose whatever distribution you like.
The lab machines use [CentOS](http://www.centos.org).

There are two ways you can install Linux.
The first is as a dual boot operating system.
Every Linux distribution's installer will walk you through how to do this.
But be careful!
It's very easy to accidentally erase all your old data!
**So far, this has happened to at least one student every quarter I've taught cs100!**
So make backups first!

The second option is as a virtual machine inside of your windows/mac computer.
This option will earn you a little bit less credit on the assignment, but is easier to set up.

**RECOMENDATION:**
Make this a group activity.
Get together with some of your classmates and spend a Saturday installing Linux on everyone's computers.
It will be a lot more fun this way, and you'll be able to help each other out when you get stuck.

### grading

25 / 25 points for a fully working bootable Linux installation.

20 / 25 points for a virtual machine Linux installation.

If you installed Linux onto a laptop, bring your laptop to class and I will check you off.  You must have wireless internet working for full credit!

If you installed Linux onto a desktop machine, then we will ssh into your desktop from the school account.  You must install the ssh daemon and configure your network routing appropriately.

**IMPORTANT:**
If you already have Linux installed on one of your machines, you do NOT have to reinstall it for this assignment.
You will get full credit.

**IMPORTANT:**
If you do not have a personal computer to install Linux on, see me and I'll work out an alternate assignment.

#### extra credit

+5 points if you install the [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) tiling window manager and use it as your default

+5 points if you set up your computer as a [tor relay](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en)
