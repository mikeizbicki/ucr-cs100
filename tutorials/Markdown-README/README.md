README Quick Reference Guide
---
* This is by no means an all inclusive list of everything you should have in your README.
* READMEs can be written in Markdown(```.md```) or as a text file (```.txt```).

Example
---
* Include an example of what your project can do, something that will grab the attention of some one who just happened upon
  your repository.

Program Overview
---
* Give a brief description of what your project is and what it is intended to do.

How to use
---
* Describe how to use your program.
* You can, but are not required to, include example code.

Prerequisites
---
* List any special or third party prerequisites needed to run your project.
* If no unordinary prerequisites are needed this section is not necessary.

Installation guide
---
* List the steps needed to install your project.
* It is better to explicitly list the commands needed rather then describe the steps. 
  * E.g. ```make``` as opposed to "run make".

Bug/Limitations/Issues
---
* Explicitly list all of the known bugs in your project.
* If there are any known limitations or issues, explicitly list those as well.
