compilation mistakes
1. fout => fdo
2. const

major logic:
3. char* ==
4. second open should have O_WRONLY
5. first open should be O_RDONLY
6. second open needs O_CREAT
7. error checking
8. open outside while loop
9. sizeof(buf)
10. replace sb.st_size with BUFSIZ
11. delete the buf if on heap
12. even better put it on stack
13. close fdi
14. write the right number of bytes
15. special error checking on read`:w
i16. fstat is worthless


extra:
* create explicit permissions
