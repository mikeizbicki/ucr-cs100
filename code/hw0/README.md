hw0 -- `rshell`

The `rshell` program is a custom shell designed to mimic most modern day shells.

It should read and execute commands on an individual basis, as well as when combined using connectors as listed below.

`cmd            = executable [argumentList] [connector cmd]

connector      = || or && or ;`
