#Introduction

Here are some videos I've mashed up with the help of my friends for your educational entertainment. Enjoy!


#read, write, open, & close

A fun video where I try to explain the read, write, open, & close functions to my friends and provide an idea of how each function runs in the code; in addition to, the common mistakes and errors that would happen to the coders if they aren't careful.

Enjoyed that clip? If you did, good for you! Now head on to the next video while my friends and I hold a funeral service for the brave troll character.


#getcwd, getpwuid, & getgrgid

A short video where I attempt to explain the contents and usage of getcwd, getpwuid, and getgrgid to my neutral, clueless friend.

These function calls are useful for getting the computer's information. Though, these video stick figures just can't seem to catch a lucky break when it comes to coding, right? Hopefully, this one would be able to crawl out of the book pile in the near future....Anyways, you can go onto the next video if you want some more humor! 


#Signals

This is a brief video about the description and usage of signals that is made purely for your amusement.

...Okay, laugh it up if you want, I won't be offended...much.

Anyways, here are the lyrics to the video above if you want to know (for whatever reasons) what they are:


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Rising up, stright to the code

did my time, took my chances

getting segfaults with the forever loops

just debug and hope that it will compile


so many times, it runs for too long

you want to stop it for an edit

through the signals and their

and their handlers

you must flag just to kill the runtime


It's the power of signals

through their handlers

from including signal dot 'h'

and by using the functions 

signal and sigaction

so let's start with the start of the flags of the signals


Control C, stands for SIGINT

A keystroke running ignores

Similar to Control Z and backslash

They start the cut and the kill of the runs


Now the signal function 

is declared in the main

and defined in a separate function

with just one int parameter

from that sigflag call

you can change what that keystroke can do in the program


SIGHUP, SIGKILL,

and SIGSTOP

can't be ignored for their callings

though for stops you'll need a kill function

with the processes's pid to commence


Resuming stop uses SIGCONT

to continue a run 

as the basics of the keystroke callings

you can mess with these signals

using these kind of flags

but make sure you don't mess with these calls all at once


Be wary with signals

be creative with signals

double check your signals

are you ready for signals?
