Flags covered in this video

|Flag	| Description of Use							|
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-e	|traces a specific system call						|
|-o	|saves strace to an output file						|
|-p	|runs strace on a running process					|
|-t	|puts timestamps on each systemcall in strace				|
|-r	|puts relative time on each systemcall in strace			|
|-c	|outputs statistics about syscalls such as # of calls and errors	|
|-f 	|follows children							|


##Why use strace?

Strace is useful for checking if a program is behaving in an unexpected manner such as crashing or taking a long time. 
Strace works best when debugging system call errors as debuggers such as GDB more useful for finding errors in the program rather tahn errors regarding syscalls.
