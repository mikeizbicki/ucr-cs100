## C++ logic and style quiz

The "SeePlusplus Logic And Style Kwiz" is a set of general-purpose programming exercises designed for beginning and intermediate programmers.

#### Exercise 1: Syntax and logic
ex1.cpp is supposed to find all the prime factors of a number, but it doesn't even compile! Who releases a project that doesn't compile correctly? Fix ex1.cpp so that it works for all cases.

#### Exercise 2: Clarity

ex2.cpp does... something. It's perfectly valid code in the eyes of whoever wrote it, and it's probably really efficient. But if you can't tell what it does by running it or looking at the source, how useful can it be?

Make this monstrosity easier to read by changing variable names, formatting the output more nicely, and adding comments if absolutely necessary.
