README Quick Reference Guide
---
* This is by no means an all-inclusive list of everything you should have in your README.
* READMEs can be written in Markdown(```.md```) or as a text file (```.txt```).

Program Overview
---
* Give a brief description of what your project is and what it is intended to do.
* Include an example of what your project can do, something that will grab the attention of someone who just happened upon your repository.

How to use
---
* Provide the information required to effectively use your project.
* You can, but are not required to, include example code.

Prerequisites
---
* List any special or third party prerequisites needed to run your project (if your project requires a library that has to be installed on its own, it is a prerequisite).
* If no unordinary prerequisites are needed this section is not necessary.
  * E.g. For a C++ project the SDL library would be a prerequisite but the vector library would not because it is included with the standard g++ installation.

Installation guide
---
* List the steps needed to install your project.
* It is better to explicitly list the commands needed rather than describe the steps. 
  * E.g. ```make``` as opposed to "run make".

Bugs/Limitations/Issues
---
* Explicitly list all of the known bugs in your project.
* If there are any known limitations or issues, explicitly list those as well.
* The more effective you are at conveying the nature of the bug/limitation/issue the better. This means being clear and concise in your wording and providing as much relevant information as possible.
  * E.g. "The foo function causes a segmentation fault when the argument passed in is negative" as opposed to "foo fails when the parameter is negative"

Things **not** to do
---
* Do not include an authors and contributors section in your README, this information can be found elsewhere on Github.
* There is no need to list the files in your repository in your README.
* Avoid listing commands in words, instead explicitly list the commands using ``` ` ``` in sequential order.
* It is not necessary to include information about your licensing beyond where to find it in your README.
