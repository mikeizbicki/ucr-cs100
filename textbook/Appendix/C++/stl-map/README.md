# STL Map

In this guide you will learn about maps and how to use them.

## What are Maps?

Maps are a container class from the [Standard Template Library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) (AKA the STL).
Despite their name, the way maps function have little to do with cartography.

A simple way to think about maps is like a snazzy array.
You can define what goes in between the ```[]``` and the types of elements that you access.

To create a map we write:
```c++
map<const key, T> var_name;
```

```const key``` is the key type, ```T``` is the element type, and ```var_name``` is the name of our map.
For example, if we want to create a map with keys of type ```string``` and elements of type ```int```, we get
```c++
map<string, int> example_map;
```

Let's look at an example of a map in use:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    //create a map
    map<string, int> books;
    //add an element
    books["fahrenheit"] = 451;
    //access an element and output it
    cout << books["fahrenheit"] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, a map ```books``` is created with ```string```s for keys and ```int```s as elements.
We then add an element ```451``` with the key ```"fahrenheit"```.
we then output the element associated with the key ```"fahrenheit"```.

## Maps with function pointers
Let's picture a nightmare scenario:

Suppose that your evil professor assigns you the task of replicating the ```ls``` terminal program.
```ls``` has a **lot** of optional flags, some of them doing exactly the same thing (ex. ```-a``` and ```--all```).

We *could* use a bunch of if-else statements:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    for (int i = 1 ; i < argc ; i++)
    {
        if(0 == strcmp(argv[i], "--all"))               printAll();
        else if(0 == strcmp(argv[i], "-a"))             printAll();
        else if(0 == strcmp(argv[i], "--long"))         printLong();
        else if(0 == strcmp(argv[i], "-l"))             printLong()
        else if(0 == strcmp(argv[i], "--Recursive"))    printRecursive();
        else if(0 == strcmp(argv[i], "-r"))             printRecursive();
        //...
        //...
        else cout << "invalid flag: " << argv[i] << endl;
    }
}
```

That could get pretty lengthy.
If we have 26 shorthand flags and 26 longhand flags, 
we would have to make 52 if-else statements PLUS CODE.
This is where we bring out our inner mad (computer) scientist.
What if we created a map with [function pointers](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/function-pointers.html) as elements?

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

void printAll();
void printLong();
void printRecursive();

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

    //create and initialize map
    map<string, void(*)()> flag_functions;
    flag_functions["--all"]         = printAll;
    flag_functions["-a"]            = printAll;
    flag_functions["--long"]        = printLong;
    flag_functions["-l"]            = printLong;
    flag_functions["--recursive"]   = printRecursive;
    flag_functions["-R"]            = printRecursive;
    //...
    //...
    
    for(int i = 1 ; i < argc ; i++) {
        void (*fp)() = flag_functions[string(argv[i])];
        //ALWAYS CHECK FOR NULL!
        //If fp is a NULL pointer, running fp() will seg fault!
        if(fp != NULL) fp();
        else cout << "invalid flag: " << argv[i] << endl;
    }
}

```

By using function pointers, we made the code more readable and made it easy to add more flags.

Don't limit your imagination to those examples though!
