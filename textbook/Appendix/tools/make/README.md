#GNU Make
---

The `make` tool automates the process of building a project from its source code.
For `make` to work, you need to add a file named `Makefile` into your project's root folder.
In this tutorial, we provide five example `Makefile`s.

Example 1: Hello World
---

Here are the contents of our first `Makefile`:
```
hello:
    cc -o hello helloworld.c

evil:
    rm -rf $HOME
```

A line that ends with a colon (`:`) creates a target.
The indented lines following a target are called a "recipe."
In this case, our first target is called `hello`, and its recipe is `cc -o hello helloworld.c`.
When you type the command
```
$ make hello
```
in the terminal, `make` opens the `Makefile`, finds the target `hello`, and runs the corresponding recipe.
In this case, we run the command `cc` to compile a program.
`cc` stands for "C Compiler" and is the default system compiler for C source code.
If you're compiling C++ code, then you would use `g++` instead.

You should never trust `Makefile`s you download from the internet.
`Makefile`s can execute arbitrary commands.
If you run
```
$ make evil
```
you will delete your home directory!

When you run:
```
$ make
```
without specifying a target, the first target gets executed.
Therefore, when you're creating your `Makefile`s, the first target should be the most important.

Example 2: Prerequisites
---

The full syntax for rules includes something called "prerequisites":

```
[targets]: [prerequisites]
    [recipe]
```

Here is an example Makefile that uses prerequisites:
```
# first rule
program: main.o file.o
    cc -o program main.o file.o

# second rule
main.o: main.c file.h
    cc -c main.c

# third rule
file.o: file.c
    cc -c file.c
```

When ```make``` or ```make program``` is run, the first rule is processed.
Since its prerequisites are targets, the rules for ```main.o``` and ```file.o``` are executed before the `program` recipe.

If ```main.o``` doesn't exist, ```make``` executes the recipe for the second rule.
But if `main.o` already exists, ```make``` executes the recipe only if ```main.c``` or ```file.h``` is more recent than ```main.o```.
This prevents us from wasting time recompiling files that haven't changed.
On a large project, this can save hours of waiting.

After the prerequisites ```main.o``` and ```file.o``` are built, if ```program``` does not exist, the recipe for the first rule is executed and the object files are linked.
Otherwise, make executes the recipe only if ```main.o``` or ```file.o``` is more recent than ```program```.

If the target from ```make [target]``` already exists and none of its prerequisites are more recent than it, `make` will report that the target is already up to date and do nothing.

For the first example, no prerequisites were used. If a file named ```hello``` already exists, then even after modifying the ```hello.c``` file, ```make``` will believe that the target is up to date and won't execute the recipe.

The `#` symbol is used for comments.
Everything after `#` will be ignored.

Example 3: Variables and Implicit Rules
---

Variables are used for readability and to avoid repetition.
The syntax for setting a variable is:
```
name = expression
```
and we use a variable by surrounding it with `$(` and `)`.

In our third `Makefile`, we create variables `objects` and `CFLAGS`:
```
objects = main.o file.o

CFLAGS = -ansi -pedantic -Wall -Werror

program: $(objects)
	cc -o program $(objects)

main.o: file.h
file.o:

clean:
	rm -f program $(objects)
```

<!--In this example, ```objects``` is set to ```main.o file.o```. The syntax for getting a variable is: ```$(name)```. In this example, ```main.o file.o``` is pasted wherever ```$(objects)``` appears.-->

In this example, the ```.c``` file prerequisites and recipe lines for the object files have been omitted. ```make``` has implicit rules for generating ```.o``` files, so it is unnecessary to spell it out. ```CC``` and ```CFLAGS``` are built-in variables that are automatically used when implicitly compiling C code. ```CXXFLAGS``` is used for C++ and ```CPPFLAGS``` is used for both C and C++.

In this example, even though there is no explicit recipe for generating ```file.o```, ```make``` will use implicit rules to execute ```$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c -o file.o file.c```.

There are a few other new things to note in this `Makefile`.

The recipe for ```clean``` breaks the convention that a rule builds its target. Instead, it removes all the files generated by make. In this way, the relevant directories become "clean."

```rm -f``` ignores nonexistent files instead of printing an error and never prompts for confirmation before removing a file.

<!--
Single logical lines can be broken into multiple physical lines with the backslash character. In this example,

```
-ansi -pedantic \
-Wall -Werror
```

is equivalent to ```-ansi -pedantic -Wall -Werror```.
-->

Example 4: Functions and Automatic Variables
---

For greater generalization and automation, functions can be used.

The ```wildcard``` function uses the syntax ```$(wildcard [pattern])```. It returns a list of space-separated files that match the pattern. The ```*``` character matches any string. In this example, ```$(wildcard *.c)``` is replaced by all ```.c``` files: ```file.c main.c```.

The ```patsubst``` function uses the syntax ```$(patsubst [pattern], [replacement], [text])```. It replaces all whitespace-separated words in ```[text]``` that match ```[pattern]``` with ```[replacement]```. The ```%``` character matches any string for all instances of ```%``` in an expression. In this example, the patsubst function is replaced by ```file.o main.o```.

```$@``` is the target of the rule. In this example, ```cc -o $@ $(objects)``` is equivalent to ```cc -o program $(objects)```.

```%.o:``` matches all object files. Because ```main.o``` requires ```file.h``` in addition to ```main.c```, that prerequisite is indicated in the next line. The implicit rules handle the rest.

The rule for ```clean``` has been modified to use the wildcard. It is subtly different from the previous version, which removed all files specified by ```objects``` -- this version removes all files ending in ```.o```.

Makefile 4:
```
CFLAGS = -ansi -pedantic -Wall -Werror
objects = $(patsubst %.c, %.o, $(wildcard *.c))

program: $(objects)
	cc -o $@ $(objects)

%.o:
main.o: file.h

clean:
	rm -f program *.o
```

Example 5: Directories
---

Files are sometimes organized by their type. One setup is to put all the source code files in a directory called ```src```, object files in a directory called ```obj```, and binary executable in a directory called ```bin```.

```VPATH``` is a variable that tells make which directories to search for target and prerequisite files in addition to the working directory. In this example, make will search ```src/``` in addition to the working directory.

Multiple directories are delimited by ```:```. For example, ```VPATH = src1:src2:../src3``` tells make to search ```src1/```, ```src2/```, and ```../src3``` in addition to the working directory.

The ```addprefix``` function uses the syntax ```(addprefix [prefix], [names...])```. It prepends ```[prefix]``` to each name in the whitespace-separated ```[names...]``` and returns the result. In this example, the ```addprefix``` function is replaced by ```obj/main.o obj/file.o```.

Order-only prerequisites are listed after ```|```. Unlike normal prerequisites, ```make``` does not check whether it is more recent than the target. The syntax for rules is updated to:

```
[targets]: [normal prerequisites] | [order-only prerequisites]
    [recipe]
```

Whenever a file is added to, removed from, or renamed in a directory, the timestamp of the directory is updated. It is inefficient to rebuild a target just because the timestamp of its prerequisite directory was updated. That is why it is an order-only prerequisite.

```$<``` is the first prerequisite of the rule. In this example, it would be the C source file corresponding to the target object file.

Makefile 5:
```
VPATH = src
CFLAGS = -ansi -pedantic -Wall -Werror
objects = $(addprefix obj/, main.o file.o)

bin/program: $(objects) | bin
    cc -o $@ $(objects)

obj/%.o: %.c
    cc $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<
obj/main.o: file.h

$(objects): | obj

bin:
    mkdir bin

obj:
    mkdir obj

clean:
    rm -rf obj bin
```
