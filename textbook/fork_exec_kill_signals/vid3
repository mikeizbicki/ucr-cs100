Intro
	Hello, this is Kenny and I am going to be talking to you about the UNIX command kill(and the variations).

	For just this video, we will be talking about killing processes.

	If you remember from our last video, I was talking about how you can retrieve the process ID number, PID, by using the ps command.

	Using either the PID or command name, you can effectively kill a program.

Description

	Say how you have to be the user to kill the process

	For security issues, linux does not allow other users to kill processes of other users

	Can kill any processes if root/sudo user

	Pull up kill -l

	Briefly talk about signals(more in depth in next video)

	Explain the differences between kill and killall

	kill uses PID to indicate what to kill

	killall uses the command name to kill any process with that command name.

	kill can often not work(as if it is only politely asking the process to die)

	use kill -9 instead(the -9 flag or SIGKILL cannot be ignored)

	kill's arguments can only be PIDs or the number of the signal you want to pass through

	killall -9 does the same thing but with the command name

	killall can use the arguments with the signal name(without the SIG part)

	killall -KILL same as killall -9

	kill bash just for fun

Usage

	Kill off zombie processes that are taking up resources

	Maybe an application has stopped working and you can't end it by normal means

	Send a certain signal to a process (more in depth in next video)
