Intro

	Hello, this is Sandie and I am going to be talking to you about the other use of kill.

	Using kill to send signals to processes.
	In the previous video we used kill -9 and killall -9.

	The -9 actually meant passing the signal SIGKILL to those processes. SIGKILL will drop the process immediately as long as under STAT isn't a letter D.

	We are going to talk about other signals you can pass to those processes.

Description

	Briefly talk about certain signals we use in everyday coding.

	Ctrl-C, SIGINT, is to kill running processes in the foreground process.

	Ctrl-\, SIGQUIT, is to quit a program and to core dump

	Ctrl-Z, is to stop the foreground process

	Talk about how SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can not be caught or ignored

	Why SIGKILL is effective (in most cases)
