We often encounter situations that require us to sort an array in a particular order. 
In CS 100, we are required to sort our file display alphabetically by "ls" function. 
Instead of writing it ourselves, we could use the C++ Standard Library `sort` with less codes and higher efficiency. 
Besides, we discusses the char array pointer memory allocation.

`sort` takes two random-access iterators, the start and the end. 
It performs a sort on the range of elements between the two iterators, front-inclusive and end-exclusive: [start, end). `sort` function is included from the algorithm header of the C++ Standard Library, and carries three arguments: the start value, the end value, and  the compare function. 
The third argument has a default value - the "less-than" (<) operator to compare elements.

`sort` is defined as:
```
default (1)
template <class RandomAccessIterator>
  void sort (RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last);
custom (2)
template <class RandomAccessIterator, class Compare>
  void sort (RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp);
```
#Sort(1)- default form
Here is a basic example for default form:
```
	int array[] = { 23, 5, -10, 0};//This is the array need to be sorted
	sort(array, array + 4);//The array is sorted and stored in the origin space
```
The output is:
```
-10, 0, 5, 23
 ```
It sorts all the elements between start and end. 
In fact, `sort` goes over all successive arrays from the start address to the end address. 
Thus, it could be used to sort only some parts of an array.
```
	char array[] = { 'a', 'p', 's', 'd', 'k', 'b', 'c'};
	int elements = 3;
	sort(&array[3], &array[3] + elements);//sort between the 4th element and the 6th
```
The result may look like:
```
a, p, s, b, d, k, c//This case only d, k, b are sorted.
```
#Sort(2)- custom forms
`sort` is powerful because we can have any particular orders with compare function. 
It can be either a function pointer or a function object. 
Compare function accepts two elements in the range as arguments and returns a value convertible to boolean which indicates the order. 
This is the example of compare function: 
```
bool compare(const char p1,const char p2)//sort descendingly
{
	if (p1>p2) return true;
	else return false;
}
```
##default compare function
There are lots of default compare functions in standard library, such as greater、less with different types. 

The 4th example is about how to sort a char array by default:
```
	char array[] = { 'a', 'p', 's', 'd', 'k', 'b', 'c', 'D','Z','1','0'}; 
	sort(array, array + 11,less<char>());//default compare function with less char 
	...
	sort(array, array + 11,greater<char>());//default compare function with less char
```
The result is not in alphabetically order but acsii order, however.
```
0 1 D Z a b c d k p s 
s p k d c b a Z D 1 0
```
##write your own alphabetical compare function
To get desired sequence, we need to write compare functions ourselves. 

Firstly, we should look at compare function. 
The default `<` compares the ascii numbers with the two inputs and it returns true when the first one has a smaller ascii number than the second one.
```
bool compare(const char p1, const char p2)//sort descendingly
{
	if (p1<p2) return true;
	else return false;
}
```
It returns true when the first input should be put in the front of the second one in the sorted sequence. 
Otherwise, it returns false.
###convert input
In order to sort alphabetically, we need to convert uppercase letter into lowercase. 
However, valid comparison requires two const inputs. 
If you try to change their value, it could not pass compiler.
```
bool compare(char p1,char p2)
{
	...
	p1="z";//p1 is changed, which is incompatible with compiler.
	...
}
```
When you compile, it looks like:
```
tst.cpp: In function ‘bool compare(char, char)’:
tst.cpp:10:5: error: invalid conversion from ‘const char*’ to ‘char’ [-fpermissive]
   p1="z";
     ^
```
Although we do not announce input arguments constant, `sort` makes it default. Thus, in order to change its value, you need to pass it to a new variable first.
```
bool compare(const char p1,const char p2)
{
	char p3=p1;//p3 is not const
	char p4=p2;//p4 is not const
	...
}
```
When you look at p3 and 'A', you should compare the ascii numbers with 'p3' and 'A'. It is also true when 'p3' plus or minus 'A'.
```
bool compare(const char p1,const char p2)
{
	...
	if(p3>='A'&&p3<='Z')
	{
		p3=p3+'a'-'A';//change uppercase letter into lowercase letter
	}
	...
}
```

##Sort char arrays
In our homework, we are required to compare two file names, which are char arrays.

###pass char array
Initial guesses seems like:
```
int main() 
{
	char array[][10] = { "abc", "pab", "slm", "dfp", "ktw", "b", "bac","DFq","Z"};
	int elements = 10; //number of example char array
	sort(array, array+elements);
	...
}
```
However, it would not pass compiler. 
In order to pass char array to compare function, we need to give char address to char array pointer. 
This is the 6th example:
```
	char array[][10] = { "abc", "pab", "slm", "dfp", "ktw", "b", "bac","DFq","Z"};
	int elements = 10; 
	char *p[10];
	for(int i=0;i<10;i++)//give array address to pointer
	{
		p[i]=array[i];
	}
	sort(p, p+elements);
	...
}
```
The output looks like:
```
abc pab slm dfp ktw b bac DFq Z
```
It seems that there are no default compare functions to sort char arrays, so we write one ourselves.

###char arrays compare function

We try to write compare function for alphabetical order. 

At first, we should convert both two arguments into lowercase or uppercase letters. 
In order to do that, we must assign them to two new char arrays.
```
bool compare(const char *p1, const char *p2)//sort alphabetically
{
	char q1[MAXLINE];
	strcpy(q1,p1);//copy input array p1 into another argument q1
	char *q3;
	q3=convert(q1);//convert q1 to lowercase letter
	...
}
```
Inside `convert`, we convert all the uppercase letters into lowercase ones by operating on elements' ascii number.
```
	if((a[k]>='A'&&a[k]<='Z'))
	{
		a[k]=a[k]+'a'-'A';
	}
```
As we can see, C or C++ use pointers to pass array. 
We return the array pointer instead of the array itself:
```
char* convert(char *a)//remain only a~z and 0~9
{
	char *q=&a[0];
	...
	return q;
}
```
After you run  `"abc", "pab", "slm", "dfp", "ktw", "b", "bac","DFq","Z"`, the result seems like:
```
abc b bac dfp DFq ktw pab slm Z 
```

##sort other types
`sort` not only applies to an array or arrays, but also vectors or structs. 
This is an example of vector rewrote from Wikipedia:
```
	vector<int> vec {10, 5, 100};
	sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
```
This needs c++11 standard to compile. Use the command like this:
```
$g++ -g -std=c++11 8_example.cpp 
```
The output is
```
5 10 100
```
For struct, we now have another example. 
Initialization involves standard c++11 features, so compile it with `-std=c++11`.
```
struct data
{
	int a;
	int b;
	int c;
}; 
bool cmp(data x,data y)
{
	if(x.a!=y.a)
	{
		return x.a<y.a;
	}
	else if(x.b!=y.b)
	{
		return x.b>y.b;
	}
	else
	{
		return x.c>y.c;
	}
}
int main()
{
	struct data tst[4];
	sort(tst,tst+4,cmp);
	...
}
```
In this example, we sort struct by `.a` ascending order first, `.b` descending second and `.c` descending third. 
We run our program on data 
```
	tst[0]={3,4,2};
	tst[1]={2,4,5};
	tst[2]={2,5,5};
	tst[3]={2,5,6};
```
The result looks like:
```
Before sort:
a=3 b=4 c=2
a=2 b=4 c=5
a=2 b=5 c=5
a=2 b=5 c=6

After sort:
a=2 b=5 c=6
a=2 b=5 c=5
a=2 b=4 c=5
a=3 b=4 c=2
```
#Char array memory allocation instruction
Let us look at 7th example's compare function again.
```
bool compare(const char *p1,const char *p2)//sort alphabetically
{
	char q1[MAXLINE];
	strcpy(q1,p1);
	char *q3;
	...
}
```
We use char array pointers without memory allocation and there is no memory leak. 
Because the message is stored at its origin char array, there is no need to allocate another space for the pointer. 
In some sense, origin char array seems like a container. 
The message already had a container for itself, and then it does not require new place for storage.
##no origin char array
What if there is no origin container? It means there is no origin char array. 
Then, you need to allocate some memory space to store the message and free it when you finish. 
Look at the 10th example to compare:
```
bool compare(const char *p1,const char *p2)//sort alphabetically
{
	...
	char *q4=(char*)malloc(MAXLINE*sizeof(char));//allocate memory to char array pointer
	*q4=*p2;//pass p2 value to q4
	...
}
```
We use `valgrind` to test:
```
==24216== HEAP SUMMARY:
==24216==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==24216==   total heap usage: 31 allocs, 31 frees, 310 bytes allocated
==24216== 
==24216== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
```
It looks fine. Also, we may have the same result if we run it on the same char arrays:
```
abc b bac dfp DFq ktw pab slm Z
```
##difference about these two versions
These two versions have the same result. 
In the first program, `q4` is just a nickname for us to operate the char array, and `q2`stores it . 
In the second one, `q4` is allocated memory space manually by `malloc` to store it. 
The `malloc` would necessarily come with the `free` at last. 
They both use the same amount of space to store the message.

The advantage of first version is that you do not need to free it. 
Therefore, you do not need to consider when to free it. 
The advantage of second version is that you could allocate memory dynamically to save memory. 
To be more detailed, it looks like:
```
char *q4=(char*)malloc(strlen(p2)*sizeof(char));
```
The disadvantages are the opposite.

In conclusion, `malloc` and `free` make the system works efficiently while you need to consider when to free memory carefully. 
Using only char array without `malloc` is easy but inefficient. 
As the data increases, dynamic memory allocation saves lots of space, but it also makes it more difficult for you to decide when to free memory. 
Just like the old saying goes: "every coin has two sides". 
It is up to you to decide which version to use.
