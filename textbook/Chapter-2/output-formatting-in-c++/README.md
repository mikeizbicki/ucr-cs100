##Output Formatting in C++

In this tutorial, we are going to explore some of the obscure text formatting tools that are available in C++. By the end, you will understand how to print lists into columns, print integers in multiple bases, and manipulate various attributes of your terminal's font using ANSI codes.

##iomanip

*iomanip* is a library dedicated to input and output manipulations. In this document we will cover four aspects of I/O manipulation: Base changes, text organization, text alignment, and filling empty space.

####Changing Base

`setbase()` allows you to display numbers in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal. Here's an example.

code:
```
cout << setbase(16) << 26 << endl;
cout << setbase(10) << 26 << endl;
cout << setbase(8) << 26 << endl;
```
output:
```
1a
26
32
```
The above code will output the number 26 three times. Once in hexadecimal, once in decimal, and once in octal. This function is especially useful when dealing with bitwise operations, because you can change your output to display in hex or octal. A common use for setbase is file permission manipulation. File permissions are stored in integers but they aren't understandable unless they are represented in octal.

####Organizing Text
`setw()` is a useful function when dealing with columns of output. `setw()` sets the width of a cell, so you can easily create a spreadsheet or other types of formatted text. Here's an example.

code:
```
cout << setw(10) << "apple";
cout << setw(10) << "orange";
cout << setw(10) << "cherry" << endl;
cout << setw(10) << "plum";
cout << setw(10) << "pumpkin";
cout << setw(10) << "grape" << endl;
```
output:
```
     apple    orange    cherry
      plum   pumpkin     grape
```
The above code prints out a table of six elements into two rows and three columns. Each element can be up to 10 characters long. If any element is longer than 10 characters, it will cause the rest of the line to shift. `setw()` does not permanently set the new width. It only applies to the next string passed into the output stream. That is why it is called before every line of output in the given code.

####Text Alignment

You can also alter the alignment of text using the *iomanip* library. To adjust the alignment of text, you have to set the justification. Here's an example of left justification:

code:
```
cout << left;
cout << setw(10) << "apple";
cout << setw(10) << "orange";
cout << setw(10) << "cherry" << endl;
cout << setw(10) << "plum";
cout << setw(10) << "pumpkin";
cout << setw(10) << "grape" << endl;
```
output:
```
apple     orange    cherry    
plum      pumpkin   grape     
```
Adding `cout << left;` aligns the text to the left side of the screen. Unlike, `setw()` the justification only has to be set once and all of the following output will adhere to it until it is set to something else. There are three justification options, `left`, `right`, and `internal`. The first two are self-explanatory. `internal` left justifies the signs of numbers and right justifies the magnitude of said number. For example, `cout setw(5) << internal << -57` could output `-  57`. This is useful for making a long list of numerical operations, for example in accounting. 

####Filling Empty Space

The last tool from *iomanip* that I will cover is `setfill()`. `setfill()` allows you to change the character in the empty spaces that appear when using `setw()`.

code:
```
cout << left << setfill('.');
cout << setw(10) << "apple";
cout << setw(10) << "orange";
cout << setw(10) << "cherry" << endl;
cout << setw(10) << "plum";
cout << setw(10) << "pumpkin";
cout << setw(10) << "grape" << endl;
```
output:
```
apple.....orange....cherry....
plum......pumpkin...grape.....
```
Pretty straight forward again, just pick a character and that's what `setw()` will fill into the empty spaces.

*iomanip* has a few more interesting functions that I'm just going to skip for now. Feel free to look them up in the C++ documentation for [*iomanip*](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iomanip/).

###ANSI Escape Codes

ANSI escape codes are another tool for I/O manipulation. Using ANSI escape codes, you can alter the foreground or background colors and underline or bold your output.

####Altering Text Color

Using ANSI codes in C++ is pretty funky so let's start with an example.
```
cout << "\033[41;33mHello World!" << endl";
```
This code outputs "Hello World!" with yellow font and red highlighting.

The important part is `\033[41;33m`. This is how ANSI codes are formatted. First, `\033[` must always start your ANSI code. Next comes a list of numbers separated by semicolons. In this case, 41 and 33 mean red highlighting and yellow font. You can implement any of the ANSI formatting options by simply inserting specific numbers in the ANSI code. In this example, only two options are used, but you can add as many as you want. Finally, `m` ends the ANSI code. After the ANSI code, everything prints according to the new formatting until a new ANSI code is encountered.

Font color can be set using codes 30 - 37. Highlighting can be set using codes 40 - 47. Other formatting options, such as underlining, bolding, etc. each have a corresponding number that can be added to the list. For a full list, check out this [table](http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences.php).

A cleaner way to incorporate ANSI codes is to store each code in a separate strings. Like this:
```
string black = "\033[30m";
string red = "\033[31m";
string green = "\033[32m";
string yellow = "\033[33m";
string blue = "\033[34m";
string purple = "\033[35m";
string teal = "\033[36m";
string white = "\033[37m";

string reset = "\033[0m";//special ANSI code that resets to the terminal's default colors

cout << black << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << red << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << green << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << yellow << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << blue << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << purple << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << teal << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
cout << white << "Hello World!" << reset << endl;
```
This code prints "Hello World!" in every color available in ANSI. Storing the code in strings makes them much more readable. This can be done for any of the other formatting settings. Another useful option is to make functions that take strings as parameters and return the same strings with ANSI codes attached.
```
string redFont(string in){
	string red = "\033[31m";
	string reset = "\033[0m";
	return red + in + reset;
}
```
The function returns the ANSI code for `red`, concatenated with the now formatted text `in` and the ANSI code for `reset`. `reset` is added at the end in order to reset the formatting of output back to its default. Once again, this concept can be extended to any of the ANSI formatting options.

####Underlining And Bolding 
Some other attributes you can set with ANSI codes include underlining and bolding. These are just as simple to set as the colors are. The 4 corresponds to underlining and the 1 corresponds to bolding. So, to add these to colored and highlighted text, we simply add two new strings to hold the new ANSI codes, `underline` and `bold`. Here's what that will look like:
```
string red = "\033[31m";
string yellowHL = "\033[43m";

string underline = "\033[4m";
string bold = "\033[1m";

cout << underline << bold << red << yellowHL << "Hello World!" << endl";
```
This will print "Hello World!" in red, with yellow highlighting, underlined, and bolded.

So thatâ€™s a small taste of what you can do with ANSI. If you followed this tutorial and cannot get the ANSI formatting to work, it is possible you are using a console that does not support those features. I am using the default terminal that comes with Debian and everything works fine. The console that comes with Code::Blocks on Windows however, does not support ANSI. A common symptom of a console that does not support ANSI is junk characters being printed.

I've included a header file called *ANSIfontUtils.h* that contains strings for all of the ANSI codes for font coloring and highlighting, underlining, bolding, and resetting colors to terminal defaults. It also contains functions that apply those ANSI codes to strings automatically. Feel free to use it to spice up your output!
