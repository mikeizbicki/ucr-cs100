Directions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil
Season chicken with salt and black pepper; set aside
Whisk sugar, cayenne pepper, white wine vinegar, fish sauce, and peanut butter together in a bowl
Coat the inside of a large skillet or wok with olive oil and place over high heat
Cook and stir chicken in the hot oil just until the meat is white outside but still pink inside, about 3 minutes
Remove chicken and set aside in a bowl
Lower the heat under the skillet to medium-low. Cook and stir garlic in the skillet until it becomes translucent, 1 to 2 minutes
Cook and stir eggs into garlic until loosely cooked, 2 to 3 minutes
Pour peanut sauce into the garlic and eggs, and stir to combine. Bring sauce to a simmer
Stir rice noodles into the boiling water. Cook until noodles are still slightly tough, about 5 minutes
Drain the noodles
Return chicken to the skillet with eggs and sauce. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, stirring frequently, 5 to 8 more minutes
Stir bean sprouts, rice noodles. and beef broth into the skillet. Bring to a simmer, and cook until noodles are tender and most of the broth has been absorbed, about 10 minutes
Sprinkle with green onions to serve.
