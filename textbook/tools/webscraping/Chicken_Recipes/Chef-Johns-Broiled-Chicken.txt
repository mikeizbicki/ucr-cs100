Chef John's Broiled Chicken
--------------------------------------------------
Ingredients
--------------------------------------------------
1 small
onion, sliced
1 (3 pound)
whole chicken, cut in half, backbone removed
salt as needed
--------------------------------------------------
Directions
--------------------------------------------------
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler
Spread onion slices in a single layer on the bottom of a baking dish. Season chicken with salt. Place chicken halves, skin-side down, over onion rings
Cook chicken in the preheated oven, turning every 7 minutes, until caramelized, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)
