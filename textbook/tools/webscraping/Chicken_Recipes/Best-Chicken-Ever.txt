6
skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 cups
sour cream
2 cups
crushed cornflakes cereal
1 teaspoon
Italian-style seasoning
6 tablespoons
butter, melted
--------------------------------------------------
Directions
--------------------------------------------------
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
Rinse and trim the chicken breasts. Pat dry. Generously coat both sides of each breast with sour cream. Put crushed cornflake crumbs in a shallow plate or bowl and season to taste (I use onion salt and garlic salt). Dip the sour cream coated chicken in the seasoned cornflake crumbs
Place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with melted butter/margarine and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour
