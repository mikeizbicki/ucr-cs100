1 tablespoon

Directions
--------------------------------------------------
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut chicken into about 1 inch X 2 inch pieces
In a large nonporous glass dish or bowl, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, sherry, ginger and five spice powder. Mix together. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat. Cover dish and refrigerate for 20 minutes, turning once, to marinate. After 20 minutes, drain chicken, reserving marinade. Boil reserved marinade in a small saucepan for 5 minutes to remove risk of bacteria
Meanwhile, spread sesame seeds out evenly on an aluminum foil-lined cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, to toast, for 10 minutes or until slightly browned
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. In a shallow dish or bowl combine flour and salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Brown chicken pieces in oil for about 1 minute each side. Spoon boiled marinade over chicken, reduce heat and saute all together for 1 more minute or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside
Remove chicken pieces from heat and roll in toasted sesame seeds. Rinse and dry lettuce leaves; line serving platter with leaves and spoon chicken on top. Garnish with tomato wedges and serve
