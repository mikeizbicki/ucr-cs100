Salt and Vinegar Chicken
--------------------------------------------------
Ingredients
--------------------------------------------------
2 cups
cider vinegar
1 cup
vegetable oil
1
egg, lightly beaten
3 teaspoons
salt
1 teaspoon
poultry seasoning
8
boneless chicken thighs, with skin
--------------------------------------------------
Directions
--------------------------------------------------
In a large bowl, mix the cider vinegar, vegetable oil, egg, salt, and poultry seasoning. Place the chicken thighs in the bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
Arrange the chicken thighs in a baking dish, and cover with about 1/4 of the marinade mixture
Bake chicken 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Drain off the marinade so that the chicken skin will become crisp (a baster works well for extracting the marinade). Continue baking 15 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear
