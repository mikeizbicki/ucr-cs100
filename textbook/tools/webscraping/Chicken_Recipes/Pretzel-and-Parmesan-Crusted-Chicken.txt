Pretzel and Parmesan Crusted Chicken
--------------------------------------------------
Ingredients
--------------------------------------------------
1 cup
light olive oil
3 cloves
garlic, minced
1 tablespoon
chopped fresh basil
1 1/2 teaspoons
dried rosemary
1 teaspoon
ground thyme
ground black pepper to taste
4
skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
7 ounces
hard sourdough pretzels
2/3 cup
freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons
dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon
garlic powder
--------------------------------------------------
Directions
--------------------------------------------------
Whisk together olive oil, minced garlic, basil, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper in a bowl
Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about 1 inch
Transfer chicken breasts to the bowl with the olive oil marinade; cover and refrigerate overnight
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
Place pretzels and Parmesan cheese into a food processor; pulse until the pretzels are finely crushed and combined with cheese
Mix in parsley and garlic powder by pulsing once or twice. Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish
Remove chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade
Press chicken into pretzel mixture, coating both sides
Arrange coated chicken in a baking dish. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon additional pretzel mixture on top
Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)
Cover chicken with a foil tent and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving
