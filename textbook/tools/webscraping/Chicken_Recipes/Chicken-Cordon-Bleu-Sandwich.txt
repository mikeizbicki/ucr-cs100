Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil
Combine bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon melted butter in a small bowl
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir ham and onion in melted butter until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in thyme and cook for 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour has lost its raw smell, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and pour in 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk. Place saucepan back over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thick, 1 to 2 minutes
Remove saucepan from heat and add 1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese, Dijon mustard, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. Stir to combine
Stir chicken and diced pickle into cheese sauce
Place toasted bread slices on the prepared baking sheet. Brush one side of each bread slice with 3/4 teaspoon melted butter. Turn slices over and top each with 1/4 of the cheese sauce. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon shredded Gruyere cheese over the top of each sandwich. Top with bread crumb mixture
Bake sandwiches in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and chicken mixture is hot, 15 to 20 minutes
