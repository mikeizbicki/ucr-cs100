Ingredients
--------------------------------------------------
1 whole
chicken, cut into 8 pieces
1
onion, cut into wedges
1
lemon, sliced
8 cloves
garlic
4 sprigs
fresh rosemary
1/4 cup
olive oil
1/2 teaspoon

1/2 teaspoon
ground black pepper
--------------------------------------------------
Directions
--------------------------------------------------
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)
Combine chicken, onion, lemon slices, garlic, and rosemary together in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and black pepper over the chicken mixture; toss to coat. Spread chicken mixture out in the bottom of a baking dish
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)
