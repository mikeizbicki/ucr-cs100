Bring 2 quarts lightly salted water to a boil. Cook chow mein in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain
Whisk soy sauce, peanut butter, 4 teaspoons vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, and 4 teaspoons sesame oil together in a bowl until smooth
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken mixture with a slotted spoon to a bowl, retaining drippings in the skillet
Heat an additional 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet with the drippings; saute mushrooms until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds
Return the chicken to the skillet; add drained chow mein noodles, bean sprouts, and green onion. Toss mixture to distribute chicken and vegetables throughout the noodles. Drizzle peanut sauce over the noodles and toss to coat; cook until sauce is warmed, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and garnish with cilantro
