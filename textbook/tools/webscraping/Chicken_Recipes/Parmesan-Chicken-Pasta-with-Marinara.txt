1 cup

1 cup
cornmeal fryer mix
1 tablespoon
Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon

2

1 (8 ounce) package

1/2 (16 ounce) jar
3-cheese alfredo sauce

--------------------------------------------------
Directions
--------------------------------------------------
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C)
Mix flour, bread crumbs, cornmeal mix, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a resealable plastic bag. Beat eggs together in a bowl
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain
Stir alfredo sauce, cream, and wine together in a saucepan over low heat until white sauce is slightly reduced, 5 to 7 minutes
Place chicken in the resealable bag with flour mixture; seal and shake until chicken is evenly coated. Remove chicken from bag, shaking off any excess coating and dip in the egg. Return chicken to flour mixture, seal bag, and shake to coat. Remove chicken from bag and discard extra flour mixture
Fry chicken in the hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain
Place pasta on a serving platter and top with white sauce. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over white sauce and place chicken on top. Spoon marinara over chicken
