# Adjusting Git Repository for Large Files

Storing large files in a repo has the potential to consume a lot of the systmes resources so you may run into a few errors.
A common message that implies that you have run out of memory on a servor is the following error message:

  ```
    fatal: unable to create thread: Resource temporarily unavailable
    error: pack-objects died with strange error
  ```
  
If you have a repository with lots of large files, it can cause re-packing to take up a lot of limited virtual memory.
In order to get around this error we need to adjust our configurations. By typing in the following lines into your terminal,
you will limit the amount of memory that packing may take.

  ```
  git config --global pack.windowMemory "100m"
  git config --global pack.SizeLimit "100m"
  git config --global pack.threads "1"
  ```
  
**NOTE**: The numbers that you configure can be adjusted as you wish. As a rule of thumb, when adjusting the sizes is that:
  "Larger window sizes may allow your system to process a smaller number of large pack files more quickly. 
  Smaller window sizes will negatively affect performance due to increased calls to the operating systemâ€™s memory manager,
  but may improve performance when accessing a large number of large pack files."
