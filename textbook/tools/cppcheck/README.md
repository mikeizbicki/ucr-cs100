cppcheckTutorial
================

As a fair warning to readers, this tutorial was written with Linux users in mind.


Quick Info
==========

<a href="http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Cppcheck</a> is a static code analysis tool for the C/C++ programming languages. It is a versatile tool that can check non-standard code. 
The creator and lead developer is Daniel Marjam√§ki. Unlike C/C++ compilers and many other analysis tools it does not detect syntax errors in the code. 
Cppcheck primarily detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally do not detect. 
The goal is to detect only real errors in the code. 

Cppcheck is free software under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a>.


HOW TO INSTALL

What cppcheck can and can't do
=============================
##Capabilities of cppcheck

* out of bounds error check as seen [below](#outofbounds)
* class code checks
* code exception checking
* [memory leak checking](#memoryhole) to a certain extent
* obselete function usage warning
* invalid usage of STL
* usage of [uninitialized variables](#randomvariable) and [unused functions](#uselessfunction)





How To Use cppcheck
===================

Alright, enough introductions let's get to what you are really interested in; how do you actually use this debugger?

<a name="outofbounds"></a>
In the code below, the user initializes a char array of size 10 and then assigns 0 to slot #10.
This seems ok at first glance, however the user forgot that by declaring an array of size 10, the array indices go from 0 to 9.
What this means is that in the code line `a[10] = 0;` the `[10]` would go out of bounds.

```
int main()
{
	char a[10];
	a[10] = 0;

	return 0;
}
```

By running the command: `cppcheck badcode.cpp` the user is given the following:

```
$ cppcheck badcode.cpp
Checking badcode.cpp...
[badcode.cpp:10]: (error) Array 'a[10]' accessed at index 10, which is out of bounds.
$
```

Simply what this error states is that there is an assignment accessed at an out of bounds index.
This is just one method of using cppcheck to check your code for errors the compiler will not check at compile time.



cppcheck Examples
=================

<a name="randomvariable"></a>
##Useless/Unused Variable Checking
```
int foo(int x)
{
	int i;
	if(x > 0)
	{
		std::cout << "X is greater than 0." << std::endl;
		i = 1;
	}
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck --enable=style unusedvar.cpp
Checking unusedvar.cpp...
[unusedvar.cpp:9]: (style) The scope of the variable 'i' can be reduced.
[unusedvar.cpp:13]: (style) Variable 'i' is assigned a value that is never used.
$
```
####Why?
In this example, we see some stylistic problems with this code. 
While it may not cause any problems in the program, it is good practice to not have unnecessary code.
Although, cppcheck does not normally display these style isses.
In order to display the style issues, we run the command `--enable=style`.
At the same time, enabling style will also enable warning, performance, and portability issues.

<a name="uselessfunction"></a>
##Useless/Unused Function Checking
```
void greaterThanZero(int x)
{
	int i;
	if(x > 0 )
	{
		std::cout << "X is greater than 0." << std::endl;
		i = 1;
	}
}

int foo(int x, int y)
{
	return x + y;
}

int main()
{
	int a = 1
	int b = 2;
	int c = 3
	foo(a,c);

	return 0;
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck --enable=all useless.cpp
Checking useless.cpp...
[useless.cpp:9]: (style) The scope of the variable 'i' can be reduced.
[useless.cpp:13]: (style) Variable 'i' is assigned a value that is never used.
[useless.cpp:24]: (style) Variable 'b' is assigned a value that is never used.
Checking usage of global functions..
[useless.cpp:7]: (style) The function 'greaterThanZero' is never used.
$
```
####Why?
Because you wrote a function when it wasn't even needed. Sheesh what a waste of time.
Ok, fine here's what this code is and does. We added the main function and we still get the same as errors for not using variables i, but now we also get errors for an unused function `greaterThanZero`.
_l2Code_
To fix the problems listed above in the cppcheck report would be to remove the unused function and to remove the variables that were not used.
What we will be left with will be the `main()` function and the `foo(int x, int y)` function.
By removing the `greaterThanZero(int x)` function, we fix the errors stating how `Variable 'i' is assigned a value that is never used` and `The function 'greaterThanZero' is never used`.


<a name="memoryhole"></a>
##Memory Leaks
```
int main()
{
	int *a;
	a = new int[10];
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck memleak.cpp
Checking memleak.cpp...
[memleak.cpp:11]: (error) Memory leak: a
$
```
####Sheesh a leak in this code... why??
Since the code allocated memory of 10 for a, there should have been followup code at the end calling `delete []a;`.
However since this was not done, a memory leak occurs where dynamically allocated memory was never freed.
Ideally the code should look like the following:
```
int main()
{
	int *a;
	a = new int[10];

	delete []a;
}
```
This code will result in the `[memleak.cpp:11]: (error) Memory leak: a` error being cleared.

##More Memory Leaks
```
void leakseverywhere(void)
{
	float *a = malloc(sizeof(float) * 45);
}
 
int main(void)
{
	leakseverywhere();
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck leaky.cpp
Checking leaky.cpp...
[leaky.cpp:14]: (error) Memory leak: a
$
```
####Why is there memory vegetable?!?
Aside from using bad coding practices like using `malloc` instead of `a = new float[somenumber]`, this code is similar to the one prior to this.
By not using the `free` call to free the allocated memory, the leak will occur when the pointer called "a" goes out of scope.
Ideally the code should looks something like this:
```
void leakseverywhere(void)
{
	float *a = malloc(sizeof(float) * 45);
	free(a);
}

int main(void)
{
	leakseverywhere();
}
```
By calling `free(a);` the program will free the allocated memory.
This works similarly to the c++ call of `delete []a;`.


Bugs that cppcheck does not find
====================================
<a name="styleuse"></a>
With beginner programmers, these kind of mistakes happen often. 
The following code is a great example of a mistake that beginner programmers might make.
##Unused function return value
```
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int TestReturn(int &x, int &y)
{
    x = 10;
    y = 20;
    return x * y;
}

int main()
{
    int a = 4
    int b = 2
    cout << b << " " << a << endl;
    TestReturn(a,b);
    cout << b << " " << a << endl;
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck Sneakycode.cpp
Checking Sneakycode.cpp...
$
```
####Why didn't it catch the bug?
So far cppcheck does not check for these stylistic bugs.
If you run this code the variables a and b change but what happens 
to the return statement in the TestReturn function? 
The return statement is essentially useless as it is discarded.
This is what we call an unused function return value.
Cppcheck does not find these bugs because it's a stylistic issue.
If we wanted to make a function that just changed the variable names, 
we would've just used a void function. 
Cppcheck focuses on the bugs that matter and not stylistic issues.
Using another static debugger would be useful here.

<a name="overflowing"></a>
##Overflow
This example is to show the result of overflow. A majority of the students
have probably made the mistake of subtracting a number from 0 in an unsigned integer variable.
The following code shows what happens when you overlook the potential of overflowing.
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int i = 2147483647;
	for (int y = i;y > 0;y++)
	{
		cout << "Hello World!";
	}
return 0;
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck overflow.cpp
Checking overflow.cpp...
$
```
####Seems normal to me!
One other bug that cppcheck does not check for is overflow.
If we run this code, it would only print out "Hello World!" once.
Why does this happen?
It's because when you add 1 to the max value of a 32 bit integer it overflows.
The integer y would become -2,147,483,648 after adding 1 to y.
This stops the for loop because of the condition that y must be greater than 0. 
Cppcheck did not account for this bug which could be potentially disastrous to anyone's code.
Using the visual studio static debugger <a href="http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/" target="_blank">PVS-Studio</a> could help here. 

##Out of bounds on arrays in a function
This example was made to show that cppcheck does not cover all out of bounds on arrays.
The difference in this code from the earlier one is that the index is passed in through an argument of a function.
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void f(char c)
{
        char *p = new char[10];
        p[c] = 42;
 
        delete []p;
}
int main()
{
        f(100);
}
```

cppcheck returns:
```
$ cppcheck TrickyArray.cpp
Checking TrickyArray.cpp...
$
```
####But didn't you say it checked array bounds?
Yes, it does check array bounds, but not if its index is passed in through an argument. Currently, cppcheck does not check functions with respect of the parameter.
Cppcheck checks the body of the code but does not evaluate the whole function with the argument included. Thus, it does not give us a message about it being out of bounds.
Remember, one of the goals of cppcheck is to have little to no false positives. This is an example where cppcheck fails where other static debugger succeed.         


An Example of a Cppcheck Feature
==================================

####Inline Suppression
One way to prevent a certain error is by using inline suppression.
By following the format of `cppcheck-suppress <ERROR:ID>`, cppcheck will recognize this, and will not print out the error.
To turn on inline suppression, run the command `cppcheck --inline-suppr <FILENAME>`.
One can also suppress the error in the command line in the format of `cppcheck --suppress=<ERROR:ID> <FILENAME>`.

If you don't know what the error is called when you want to suppress it, you can run the command `cppcheck --xml <FILENAME>`.
Look for "error id = <ERROR>" for the id of the error.
Following the same format as the example, you can suppress that specific error.

The following is an example on the usage of inline suppression:
```
int foo()
{
	char arr[10];
	// cppcheck-suppress arrayIndexOutOfBounds	
	arr[15] = 1;

}
```
Looking at the first example of an array index going out of bounds, this is the same situation.

####Now why would you even do this?!
This allows you to focus on targeted errors that you are looking for.
Perhaps you already know the error is there but because you will use it (in the event of the `unused variable` error), there is no need to fix the error.
This will also help keep the noise down when debugging the code.

This inline suppression will look something like this:
```
$ cppcheck --inline-suppr inlinesupp.cpp 
Checking inlinesupp.cpp...
$
```


**Note: _You can find all the optional arguments that can be used [here](http://linux.die.net/man/1/cppcheck)._**


##Limits of cppcheck

Some limits of cppcheck include user ignorance and lack of knowledge.
Ok, joking aside, the use of cppcheck is to limit the amount of false positive errors given by other compilers and checkers.
What this means is with general usage, cppcheck will not check much but what it does check, it checks extremely well.
Similar to a crafting NPC in a game, cppcheck will tell you only what it can tell you for sure.
Given the right ingredients, or in cppcheck's case, configurations and flags, it will give you errors that are almost guaranteed to be errors.

cppcheck works in a way where it trues to avoid false positives so many of the bugs listed will be actual bugs.
this being said, there will be many things that cppcheck will not catch such as [stylistic errors](#styleuse), syntax, and [runtime](#overflowing) bugs.

*tl;dr: cppcheck is good at what it does, but use a variety of tools to fully debug your programs.*
