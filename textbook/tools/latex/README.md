#Tutorial on LaTeX

This is a tutorial on LaTeX to beginners.
As computer scientists and engineers we are supposed to produce papers and to document programs that we create.
With that being said, we want to present LaTeX — a great tool which produces beautiful type and is written in an intuitive language. 

## A brief history
**TeX** is a program designed by Donald Knuth in the 70s to allow everybody to produce high-quality written content using a fair amount of effort, and return the same output on every computer.

**LaTeX** is a program that collects commands using TeX as processing base and it was created by Leslie Lamport in the 80s in order to facilitate the use of TEX through commands for different functions.

If you want to know more about it you can check [Tex page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) and [LaTeX page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) on wikipedia!

##Structure

The LaTeX language is based on commands that always starts with `\`, which is a marker. 
The commands are written like this `\command` or between `\begin{command}` and `\end{command}`.

Example:
```latex
\documentclass {article}
\title {My first \LaTeX}
\author{your_name_here}
\begin {document}
Hello World! This is my first \LaTeX!
\end {document}
```

Everything that comes before `\begin {command}` is considered the preamble
Everything that comes after `\end {document}` is ignored. 
In the example above we used the document class "article", but there are many classes that you can use.
You can find further explanation on different classes [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Document_classes).

##Style
In the `\documentclass` tag you may want to define some of your document's properties style as optional parameters.
The only difference from the example above is the following line:

```latex
\documentclass [a4paper, 12pt, landscape] {article}
```

This is, between the `[]` we defined the paper size, the letter size, and the layout of the page.
There are many options for this tag.
If you want something more specific for your document, check [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Document_Class_Options).

This example is going to look like this once compiled:

##Packages
Packages are add-ons that implement additional features for documents written in LaTeX.
These packages are inserted in the preamble using the command `\usepackage [optional]{package}`
If you want to check the packages that are pre-installed with LaTeX, check the  [package reference page](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Package_Reference).

Example:

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{color}
\begin{document}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, pro saperet luptatum repudiandae an. 
Ex nam everti inimicus, ex has error scaevola consetetur, pericula molestiae ut usu.
Duo te consul concludaturque.
\textcolor {red} {Et blandit petentium torquatos eum, eam an facilis principes inciderint, nec an expetenda delicatissimi. 
Ut sea agam laudem}.
\end{document}
```

This example is going to look like this once compiled:

Users can also create their own packages. 
In this case, the user need to download the file and put in the same folder of the project or somewhere else that LaTeX can find. 
In the [CS Environment section](/textbook/tools/latex/README.md#cs-environment) you are going to find a example on how it works.

##Math Environment
As science, math and engineering students, using LaTeX can be really handy to write papers that include formulas.

###Setting up
There are three main ways to insert formulas or other calculations:
* **Inline** by using dollar sign to start and to end a formula. 

  Example:
  
  ```latex
  The volume inside a sphere is given by $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$.
  ```
  
  This example is going to look like this once compiled:
  ![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072377/ee23d4d2-0ec9-11e5-847f-532143a60fbb.jpg)

  
  Note that in this example the `\frac` tag was used to build a fraction.
  The first pair of curly brackets contains the numerator and the second contains the denominator.
  Also, this example uses the `\pi` tag to show the corresponding symbol to the Greek letter Pi. 

* **New line with section number** by using the `\[` operator to open and `\]`to close.

  Example:
  ```latex
  The volume inside a sphere is defined by 
  \[
  V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}
  \]
  ```
  
  This example is going to look like this once compiled:
  ![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072378/ee240b78-0ec9-11e5-87d1-9575ede43ce3.jpg)

* **New Line without section number** by using the tag `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}` to close.

  Example:
  ```latex
  The volume inside a sphere is defined by 
  \begin{equation}
  V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}
  \end{equation}    
  ```
  
  This example is going to look like this once compiled:
  ![5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072376/ee2385a4-0ec9-11e5-8595-e4e6f568186e.jpg)
  
###Building Formulas
Here come some really useful tool to build your formulas using LaTeX.
* Power.

  Example:
  ```latex
  \[
  f(x) = \sqrt{x^{a} + y^{b}}
  \]   
  ```
  As you can see, by using the syntax `x^{a}`, `x` will become the base and `b` will become an exponent.
  Thus, we will have `x` to the power of `a`. 
  
  This example is going to look like this once compiled:
  ![6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072738/429b6cc8-0ecf-11e5-9f81-3e42c52a81aa.jpg)  

* Index.

  Example:
  ```latex
  \[
  x_{3j}^{2i}
  \]   
  ```
  In this case the syntax is pretty much the same as the "power example" aforementioned.
  The only difference is the underscore to indicate it's an index. 
  
  This example is going to look like this once compiled:

###CS Environment
As Computer Scientists we may want to use LaTeX to document what we are coding.
The package `listings` handles languages in LaTeX, such as C/C++, Java and others.

Example:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{xcolor}
% Define new colors
\definecolor{green}{rgb}{0,0.5,0}
% Setting layout to display codes C ++
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{
  language=C++,
  basicstyle=\ttfamily\small, 
  keywordstyle=\color{blue}, 
  stringstyle=\color{green}, 
  commentstyle=\color{red}, 
  extendedchars=true, 
  showspaces=false, 
  showstringspaces=false, 
  numbers=left,
  numberstyle=\tiny,
  breaklines=true, 
  backgroundcolor=\color{green!10},
  breakautoindent=true, 
  captionpos=b,
  xleftmargin=0pt,
}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\begin{lstlisting}
#include 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  /* Comment */
  int n, i, a = 0, b = 1, F;
  cout << "Enter the number of terms of Fibonacci’s sequence: ";
   cin >> n;
  cout << a << " " << b << " ";
   for (i = 0; i < n - 2; i++)   {
     F = a + b;
     cout << F << " ";
     a = b;
     b = F;
   } cout << endl; return 0;
 } \end{lstlisting}
\end{document}
```
This example is in C++, but we can change to many languages. It's just change the value of the line `language=C++`

When compiled, it’s going to look like this:
![8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072540/1e718182-0ecc-11e5-8fd1-72efdc5b3658.jpg)


In order to use many languages in the same LaTeX file, we need to use this:

```
\lstdefinestyle{LaTeX}{
  language={[LaTeX]TeX},
  basicstyle=\ttfamily\small, 
  identifierstyle=\color{black}, 
  keywordstyle=\color{blue}, 
  commentstyle=\color{red}, 
  extendedchars=true, 
  showspaces=false, 
  showstringspaces=false, 
  numbers=none,
  breaklines=true,
  backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!20}, 
  breakautoindent=true, 
  captionpos=b,
  xleftmargin=0pt,
  frame=none,
  rframe={},
}
```
You can find a complete example using many languages  [here](/textbook/tools/latex/ex23.tex).

#Combining linux tools

Now, let's combine some of the main UNIX tools together, so you can have an idea on how use it in the future.

First of all, let's set our environment. 
We will be using the folder `article`. 
After creating the folder (i.e., `mkdir article`) and navigating by using the `cd` command to get in on it, initialize the git repository: 

`git init`

Time to get some TeX code finally done! Let's create and edit out first file through `vim`: 

`vim loremipsum.tex`

The following text creates a basic file.

Example:
```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, pro saperet luptatum repudiandae an. 
Ex nam everti inimicus, ex has error scaevola consetetur, pericula molestiae ut usu. 
Duo te consul concludaturque. Et blandit petentium torquatos eum, eam an facilis principes inciderint, nec an expetenda delicatissimi. 
Ut sea agam laudem. 
\end{document}
```

After saving and closing `vim`, it's time to compile our LaTeX file and create the pdf file. 
One simple command on the terminal should do all this work for us:

`pdflatex loremipsum.tex`

If everything worked fine, now you should be able to open the pdf file `loremipsum.pdf` that will look like this:

![9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072630/70987320-0ecd-11e5-8dfa-8b82ec61aee5.jpg)

If we succeed at the previous steps, it's time to do some commits. 
But first, we need to add the files to the staging area of git. 
Remember! We should commit ONLY source code, README and LICENSE files. NEVER add executable and log files. 
In the following example we are going to create some tags and branches just to exemplify the usage of `gitdags` that comes next.

```
echo "This is the most important file of your project" > README
git add README
git commit -m "Starting project"
git tag beginning
git branch coding
git checkout coding
git add loremipsum.tex
git commit -m "Added tex file"
git checkout master
git merge coding
touch LICENSE
git add LICENSE
git commit -m "Added license file"
```

In small projects you may not have a lot of commits, but in huge projects it's gonna happen all the time.
So now, we are going to present a package for drawing Git history graphs using LaTeX, called gitdags. 
It can be really helpful to draw a really nice looking git repository for this [lab1](/assignments/lab/lab1-git).

#Gitdags

`gitdags` is a LaTeX package that allows the production of pretty Git history graphs. 
The next image is an example on how your Git history graph can look like:

![11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072606/13436f40-0ecd-11e5-8ffe-a4d4cc795f65.jpg)


##What `gitdags` is *not*

Automatic generation of Git history graphs.

##Dependencies
To use `gitdags`, we will need
* [gitdags.sty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jubobs/gitdags/master/gitdags.sty) file;
* `tikz` package (v3.0+);
* [`xcolor-solarized`](https://github.com/Jubobs/xcolor-solarized) package.

If we decide to use `gitdags` to draw the Git history graphs of the example above, we may use the following code. 
The explanation is commented on it.

Example:

```latex
\documentclass[landscape, 12pt]{article}

\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage{gitdags}

\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \gitDAG[grow right sep = 2em]{ % arrow's size
        % Commits that you create appear here 
        Starting Project -- { 
          Added LICENSE file, 
          Added TEX file,
        }
      };
      % Tag reference
      \gittag
        [beginning]       % node name
        {beginning}       % node text
        {above=of Starting Project} % node placement
        {Starting Project}          % target
      % Branch
      \gitbranch
        {master}     % node name and text 
        {above=of Added LICENSE file} % node placement
        {Added LICENSE file}          % target
      % Branch
      \gitbranch
        {coding}     % node name and text 
        {below=of Added TEX file} % node placement
        {Added TEX file}          % target
      % HEAD reference
      \gitHEAD
        {above=of master} % node placement
        {master}          % target
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
```

This is just a simple example on how you can use it.
This is a preview on the code above:
![10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9004719/8072572/95ed2f2c-0ecc-11e5-93f7-f1287b58f6d3.jpg)

A more complex example can be found [here](https://github.com/Jubobs/gitdags/wiki).
I really recommend that you take a few minutes and "play" with this codes.

#Conclusion
So as you can see, we can use:
* LaTeX: to create the documents
* [git](/assignments/lab/lab1-git/using-git.md): to version control the documents
* [vim](/cheatsheets/vim-cheatsheet.pdf): to edit the text
* [Makefile](/textbook/tools/make): to put things together
* pdflatex: to output as a pdf file.

I hope you liked this tutorial and use it in the future!
