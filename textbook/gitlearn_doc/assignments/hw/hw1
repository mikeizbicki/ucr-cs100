Sample Homework #1: Your First Program

In this assignment, you will learn how to make your program read input from the
user (aka you) and send it to standard output.

Instructions:
- Create a cpp file called "hello.cpp".

- Prompt the user, asking to enter your name.

- Your program should then write to standard output a greeting, including your
what you entered as input.

- Your program should include the streams 'cin' and 'cout'.

- Compile it using 'g++' and test your executable, 'a.out', to see if it works.
Once you are done, submit the cpp file to your instructor by pushing the changes
to your forked repo using 'git push' and making a pull request.

Collaboration Policy:
- You may NOT work with other students on this assignment.
