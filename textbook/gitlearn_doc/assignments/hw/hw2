#Homework 2: Implementing the rm command
Write a C++ program that implements the GNU rm command. 
The -r/-R/--recursive and -f/--force flags should be supported.

##Testing:
rm should remove/unlink the desired files. 
rm -r, rm -R and rm --recursive should all remove directories and their contents.
rm -f and rm --force should both force removable by ignoring nonexistent files. 
Your test cases should show that these commands can be properly executed.
