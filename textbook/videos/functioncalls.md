Read & Write

	First off, some quick introductions of the narrators along with the libraries needed for the functions of open, close, read, and write. Then, I will ask my friend to make a random choice of stick figures and cars to use to represent the code"'"s performance and functions. The goal of the scenario would be to get a decryption message from point A to point B safely through the warzone, without dying. Each crash either makes the car or character in the scenario, unusable in the future scenarios.

	Next, I will display some bad code on the functions described that can compile, but needs error checking and improvements. The awfulness of the code"'"s runtime is demonstrated by various bad scenarios happening to the stick figure in it"'"s attempt to drive to it"'"s destination and absorb and present information properly. The bad scenarios range from driving without safety precautions to reading inefficiently before finally crashing into a wall. Which will be accompanied by sarcastic, random commenting and chiding from the nearrators.

	After the really bad scenario is over, the code will be edited at the said functions one part at a time. Starting with the open function, an explanation of the code before having a close up on fixing the the portion pertaining to the function in the bad code. Then, I"'"ll run the scenario again, where the character gets in the car correctly but drives off with an open door due to the fact that there is no error checking. After adding the error checking to the open function, the next fix will be about the close function, which will run through a similar process of explanatin as the previous one except with the additional details on the flags that can be used in these two functions and their details. While I explain the function, I"'" show two demo scenarios of the close function process before fixing them: one where the car goes off the cliff due to the fact that the file or path doesn"'" exist; and the other, where the character gets to its destination safely, but a car thief steals the car and rams the character, which stresses the importance of error checking in coding.

	For the read function, I"'"ll first show  what the bad code of it is doing in the scenario and ask my friend what she thinks the read function is. Then, I"'"ll give its proper description with its format on screen and the correct usage of the function in the test code. This time the bad scenario will have the stick figure reading information efficiently and using the map properly, but forgetting to put on the seatbelt. Since the car will be moving at high speeds to mimic the processor speeds and avoid hazards, the stick figure will get pulled around by the forces of motion and, when the car stops, ejected out of the vehicle. The character doesn"'"t die immediately, but delivers a long, complicated message to the receiver before doing so. This, once again, stresses the importance of error checking. After correcting the format of the read function error checks, I"'" explain the write function similarly to the read function"'"s process and correct it with the proper error checks.

	Finally, I"'"ll narrate my conclusion while my friend tries to run the scenario"'"s ending scene. The stick figure is intact and present a short message in that scene and the receiver is able to solve the encryption of the codes. Later the character is presented with a medal before getting a pie in the face. The bottom of the solved message says, '"'PS. Please pie the messenger for taking too long.'"'




Getcwd, Getpwuid, & Getgrid

	After the introductions, I"'" ask my friend about what she thinks that the system calls of getcwd, getpwuid, and getgrid are. After she gives her opinions, I"'"ll provide the proper description of what these system calls are supposed to do within a code. 
	
	By using a character to sort different colored books into bookshelves, I"'"ll explain each of these functions on their respective includes, declarations, and returns as I display their  proper usage in code. There are three labeled shelves in total and each book is given an appropriate title according to the description that it refers to for their respective system calls.

	For getpwuid and getgrid, I"'"ll display the necessary structs that they respond to for coding and wxplain what each vairable in the struct contents refor to in the codes. For these portions, I"'"ll have the charater to open the book related to these structs, where the table of contents shows the variabls of the struct, and the turn of the pages leads to a description of what that variable refers to.

	In the end, the bookshelf will be colorfully organized and filled with booktitles of their respective function and standard library descriptions. That is, before a digital earthquake hits it.


Signals music video (lyrics at the moment)

(Singing parody to '"'Eye of the Tiger'"' along with a sequence of displays on the code and it"'"s close ups)


Rising up, straight to the code
did my time, took my chances
getting segfaults with the forever loops
just debug and hope that it will compile

So many times it runs for too long
you want to stop it for an edit.
Through the signals and their handlers
You must flag just to kill the runtime

It"'"s the  power of signals
through their handlers
from including signal dot "'"h"'"
and by using the functions
Signal and sigaction
so let"'"s start with the start of the flags of the signals

Control C, Stands for SIGINT
a keystroke running ignores
Similar to Control Z and backslash
they start the cut and the kill of the runs

Now the signal function
is declared in the main
and defined in a separate function
with just one int parameter
from that sig flag call
you can change what that keystroke can do in the program

SIGHUP, SIGKILL, and SIGSTOP
can"'"t be ignored for their callings
though for stops you need a kill functin
with the process"'"s pid to commence

Resuming stop uses SIGCONT
to continue a run
as the basics of the keystroke callings
you can mess with these signals 
using the rest of these flags
but make sure you don"'" mess with these calls all at once

Be carefule with signals
be handy with signals
double check your signals
are you ready with signals?
